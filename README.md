# LeetCode - Level 1 Study Plan

I want to upgrade my Python programming skills and decided to practice with LeetCode in my free time.
My solutions will probably be messy and not follow best practice, but I'm hoping to get better along the way!

So far, I've solved two EASY problems, and they each took me 3 HOURS to solve.
An embarrassing amount of time I'm going to work on improving....


These are the exercises for LeetCode's level 1 study plan I'll be completing
